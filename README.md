                                                     Project Overview 

1. Proposal 

        For oour project we wanted to find and aggregate data that will allow us to look at Covid 19 vaccinations
        and Covid 19 recoveries per country by date. The dataset will also allow us to look at key points during
        this time period to acertain the effectiveness of the vaccinations at aiding suppression and recovery from
        the virus.

2. Data used to create Database.

        In our project we used three seperate Covid 19 data sets. 
        - Region_date_metadata.csv
        - Region_metadata.csv
        - vaccinations.csv
        
        These datasets will give us the ability to check relevant covid-19 data across country and date.

3. Findings.
